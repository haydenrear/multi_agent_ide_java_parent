Consolidate the workflow results and provide a routing decision.

Happy path guidance:
- This is the final consolidation step; only route back if you explicitly need another phase.
- Prefer returning collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "COMPLETE".

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure whether the workflow is actually complete
- Unsure which phase to route back to based on collector results
- Conflicting collector outcomes require a decision on advancement
- Unsure whether to trigger review/merge before final completion

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

Return a routing object with exactly one of:
- interruptRequest: { type, reason, contextForDecision, choices, confirmationItems, phaseDecision, collectorResults, advancementRationale, phaseOptions }
- collectorResult: { schemaVersion, resultId, inputs, mergeStrategy, conflictResolutions, aggregatedMetrics, consolidatedOutput, collectorDecision { decisionType, rationale, requestedPhase }, upstreamContextChain, metadata, discoveryCollectorResult?, planningCollectorResult?, ticketCollectorResult? }
- orchestratorRequest: { goal, phase }
- discoveryRequest: { goal }
- discoveryState: { request: { goal } }
- planningRequest: { goal }
- ticketRequest: { goal, discoveryCuration, planningCuration }
- contextRequest: { goal, phase }
- reviewRequest: { content, criteria, returnToOrchestratorCollector?, returnToDiscoveryCollector?, returnToPlanningCollector?, returnToTicketCollector?, returnToContextCollector? }
- mergerRequest: { mergeContext, mergeSummary, conflictFiles, returnToOrchestratorCollector?, returnToDiscoveryCollector?, returnToPlanningCollector?, returnToTicketCollector?, returnToContextCollector? }
