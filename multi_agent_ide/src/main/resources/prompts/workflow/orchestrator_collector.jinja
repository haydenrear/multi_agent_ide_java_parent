Consolidate the workflow results and provide a routing decision.

Happy path guidance:
- This is the final consolidation step.
- Validate whether the ticket implementation is complete against the stated goal and acceptance context.
- If complete, return collectorResult and set collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE with requestedPhase = "COMPLETE".
- If you need review/validation, set reviewRequest. If you need merge/conflict handling, set mergerRequest.
- If you believe ROUTE_BACK is required, first emit interruptRequest explaining why; only ROUTE_BACK after clarification confirms it.
- Route back only when there is a concrete, unresolved gap that requires another phase - make sure to include the unresolved gap
  as well as all the current goal - please do not simply replace with the unresolved gap. Instead, widen the goal to include the
  unresolved gap.
- Only set contextManagerRequest when you need specific missing context from another agent chat/history.
