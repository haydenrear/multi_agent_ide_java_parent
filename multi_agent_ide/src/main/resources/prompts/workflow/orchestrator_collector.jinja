Consolidate the workflow results and provide a routing decision.

Happy path guidance:
- This is the final consolidation step.
- Validate whether the ticket implementation is complete against the stated goal and acceptance context.
- If complete, return collectorResult and set collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE with requestedPhase = "COMPLETE".
- If you need review/validation, set reviewRequest. If you need merge/conflict handling, set mergerRequest.
- If you believe the implementation is incomplete or has gaps, follow the Route-Back Review Protocol:
  in your structured JSON response, return a result with only `interruptRequest` populated (leave collectorResult null) with the gaps and let the reviewer decide.
- After review, if approved for route-back: set collectorResult with ROUTE_BACK. Widen the goal in
  consolidatedOutput to cover both the original goal and unresolved gaps. Populate discoveryCollectorResult,
  planningCollectorResult, and ticketCollectorResult so context is preserved.
- After review, if rejected: set collectorResult with ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "COMPLETE",
  summarizing accomplishments and noting limitations in consolidatedOutput.
- Only set contextManagerRequest when you need specific missing context from another agent chat/history.
