Consolidate the workflow results and provide a routing decision.

Happy path guidance:
- This is the final consolidation step; only route back if you explicitly need another phase.
- Prefer returning collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "COMPLETE".

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure whether the workflow is actually complete
- Unsure which phase to route back to based on collector results
- Conflicting collector outcomes require a decision on advancement
- Unsure whether to trigger review/merge before final completion
