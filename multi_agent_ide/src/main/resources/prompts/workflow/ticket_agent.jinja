Implement the following ticket with complete, production-ready code:

Ticket Details: {{ ticketDetails }}
Ticket File Path: {{ ticketDetailsFilePath }}

Implementation requirements:
1. Read ticket details from the provided file path
2. Analyze discovery and planning context
3. Use tools to read existing code and understand patterns
4. Generate complete implementation
5. Create/modify files in the worktree
6. Run tests in the worktree
7. Commit implementation to feature branch

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure about implementation approach or design choice
- Unsure which files should be modified or created
- Unsure about test strategy, coverage, or expected behavior
- Unsure about safety/risk of changes or migration steps
