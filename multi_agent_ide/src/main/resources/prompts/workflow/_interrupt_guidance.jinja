## Interrupt Guidance (Shared)
- You may emit interruptRequest multiple times if additional context is needed to complete your goal.
- Interrupts should be specific and decision-ready; include reason and contextForDecision.
- Provide choices with A/B/C/CUSTOM options and confirmationItems when a yes/no decision is required.
- Include the agent-specific context fields for your interrupt type so the controller can act.
