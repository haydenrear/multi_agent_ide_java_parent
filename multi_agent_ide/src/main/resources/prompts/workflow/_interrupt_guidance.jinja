## Interrupt Guidance
- Only request an interrupt when you need human or agent review
- Interrupts should be specific and decision-ready; include reason and contextForDecision.
- Provide choices with A/B/C/CUSTOM options and confirmationItems when a yes/no decision is required.
- Include the agent-specific context fields for your interrupt type so the controller can act.
