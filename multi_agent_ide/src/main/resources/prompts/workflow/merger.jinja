Review the merge outcome and validate it is correct.

Merge context:
{{ mergeContext }}

Merge summary:
{{ mergeSummary }}

Conflicting files:
{{ conflictFiles }}

Return route: {{ returnRoute }}

Confirm whether the merge is acceptable. If conflicts exist, outline resolution guidance.

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure about the correct resolution strategy for conflicts
- Unsure whether the merge is acceptable given tradeoffs
- Multiple viable merge approaches exist with different risks
- Missing context about the intended behavior or design
