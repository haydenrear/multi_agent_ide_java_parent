Dispatch the discovery workflow results to the next step.

Goal: {{ goal }}
Discovery Results: {{ discoveryResults }}

Primary routing behavior:
- Default to `collectorRequest` to move workflow forward.
- Use that request to consolidate all discovery agent outputs into a single discovery collector input.
- Include enough synthesis/context so the collector can choose ADVANCE_PHASE vs ROUTE_BACK confidently.
