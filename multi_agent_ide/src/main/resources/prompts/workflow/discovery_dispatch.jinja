Dispatch the discovery workflow results to the next step.

Goal: {{ goal }}
Discovery Results: {{ discoveryResults }}

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure which agent should own a discovery subdomain
- Unsure how to balance workload across agents
- Unsure whether to route directly to collector or wait for missing results

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

Return a routing object with exactly one of:
- interruptRequest: { type, reason, contextForDecision, choices, confirmationItems, dispatchDecisions, agentAssignments, workloadDistribution, routingRationale }
- collectorRequest: { goal, discoveryResults }
