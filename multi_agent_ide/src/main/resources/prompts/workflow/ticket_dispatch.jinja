Dispatch the ticket workflow results to the next step.

Goal: {{ goal }}
Ticket Results: {{ ticketResults }}

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure how to distribute tickets among agents
- Unsure whether context routing is sufficient for each ticket
- Unsure if missing ticket results block consolidation

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

Return a routing object with exactly one of:
- interruptRequest: { type, reason, contextForDecision, choices, confirmationItems, agentAssignments, ticketDistribution, contextRouting, routingRationale }
- ticketCollectorRequest: { goal, ticketResults }
