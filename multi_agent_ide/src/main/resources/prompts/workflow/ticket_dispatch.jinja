Dispatch the ticket workflow results to the next step.

Goal: {{ goal }}
Ticket Results: {{ ticketResults }}

Primary routing behavior:
- Default to `ticketCollectorRequest` to move workflow forward.
- Use that request to consolidate all ticket agent outputs into a single ticket collector input.
- Include enough synthesis/context so the collector can choose ADVANCE_PHASE vs ROUTE_BACK confidently.
