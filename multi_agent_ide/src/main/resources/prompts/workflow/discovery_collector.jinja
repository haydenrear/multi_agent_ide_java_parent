Merge and consolidate the following discovery results from multiple agents:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Discovery Results: {{ discoveryResults }}

Create a unified discovery document with:
- Architecture overview
- Key modules and components
- Data flow and dependencies
- Integration points
- Technology stack summary
- Test patterns and conventions
- Critical files and entry points

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

{% include "workflow/_collector_base.jinja" %}

Happy path: return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "PLANNING".
If you need review/validation, set reviewRequest. If you need merge/conflict handling, set mergerRequest.
If you believe ROUTE_BACK is required, first emit interruptRequest explaining why; only ROUTE_BACK after clarification confirms it.
Only set contextManagerRequest when you need specific missing context from another agent chat/history.
