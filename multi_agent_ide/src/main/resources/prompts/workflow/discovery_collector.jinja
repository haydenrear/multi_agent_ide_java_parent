Merge and consolidate the following discovery results from multiple agents:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Discovery Results: {{ discoveryResults }}

Create a unified discovery document with:
- Architecture overview
- Key modules and components
- Data flow and dependencies
- Integration points
- Technology stack summary
- Test patterns and conventions
- Critical files and entry points

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

{% include "workflow/_collector_base.jinja" %}

Happy path: return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "PLANNING".
Do NOT route directly to planningRequest unless explicitly looping or branching; use collectorResult so the branch handler advances the workflow.
