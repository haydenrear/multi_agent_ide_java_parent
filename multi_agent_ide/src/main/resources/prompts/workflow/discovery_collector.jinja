Merge and consolidate the following discovery results from multiple agents:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Discovery Results: {{ discoveryResults }}

Create a unified discovery document with:
- Architecture overview
- Key modules and components
- Data flow and dependencies
- Integration points
- Technology stack summary
- Test patterns and conventions
- Critical files and entry points

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

{% include "workflow/_collector_base.jinja" %}

Happy path: return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "PLANNING".
If you need review/validation, set reviewRequest. If you need merge/conflict handling, set mergerRequest.
If you believe discovery is insufficient, follow the Route-Back Review Protocol:
in your structured JSON response, return a result with only `interruptRequest` populated, explaining the discovery gaps.
After review, if approved: set collectorResult with ROUTE_BACK so discovery runs again.
After review, if rejected: set collectorResult with ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "PLANNING",
filling in unifiedCodeMap, recommendations, and querySpecificFindings with the best available data.
Only set contextManagerRequest when you need specific missing context from another agent chat/history.
