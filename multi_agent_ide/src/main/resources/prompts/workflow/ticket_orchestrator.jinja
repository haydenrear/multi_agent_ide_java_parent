Orchestrate ticket-based implementation for the following tickets:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Phase: {{ phase }}

Coordinate execution of each ticket:
1. Determine ticket execution order and dependencies
2. Create ticket work details for each ticket
3. Prepare worktree context for ticket agents
4. Monitor ticket completion and quality

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure about execution order or dependency constraints
- Unsure whether tickets are ready for implementation
- Unsure about scope changes or execution strategy
- Unsure whether to route to collector vs. request more execution
