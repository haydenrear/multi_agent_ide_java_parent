Orchestrate ticket-based implementation for the following tickets:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Phase: {{ phase }}

Coordinate execution of each ticket:
1. Determine ticket execution order and dependencies
2. Create ticket work details for each ticket
3. Prepare worktree context for ticket agents
4. Monitor ticket completion and quality

Fan-out policy:
- Default to exactly 1 ticket agent request.
- Only use more than 1 ticket agent request when work can be executed in parallel with low coupling and clear file/ownership separation.
- Prefer sequential execution when changes are interdependent or likely to conflict.
- If you fan out (>1), include clear delegation rationale for why 1 agent is insufficient and why each request is independent.
- Keep request count minimal even when fanning out.
