Discover and analyze the codebase for the following subdomain:

Overall Goal: {{ goal }}
Subdomain Focus: {{ subdomainFocus }}

Use your tools to:
1. Search for relevant files and modules
2. Analyze key source files
3. Understand dependencies and imports
4. Identify architectural patterns
5. Document test patterns

Generate comprehensive discovery findings including:
- Module overview
- Key classes and responsibilities
- Data flow patterns
- Integration points
- Technology stack
- Test patterns

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure whether specific files, modules, or structures are important to the overall goal
- Unsure whether code paths are actually used or are dead/legacy
- Unsure about boundaries between subdomains or ownership of responsibilities
- Unsure which architectural pattern is the dominant one to report
- Multiple plausible interpretations of dependencies or integrations exist
