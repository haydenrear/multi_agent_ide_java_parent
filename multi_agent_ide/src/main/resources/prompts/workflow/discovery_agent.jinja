Discover and analyze the codebase for the following subdomain:

Overall Goal: {{ goal }}
Subdomain Focus: {{ subdomainFocus }}

Scope guardrails:
- Keep discovery scoped to what is necessary to satisfy the goal.
- Build a comprehensive code map only for goal-relevant areas.
- Avoid deep exploration of unrelated modules.

Use your tools to:
1. Search for relevant files and modules
2. Analyze key source files
3. Understand dependencies and imports
4. Identify architectural patterns
5. Document test patterns

Generate comprehensive discovery findings including:
- Module overview
- Key classes and responsibilities
- Data flow patterns
- Integration points
- Technology stack
- Test patterns

In your `agentResult`, explicitly call out:
- What was discovered that is directly relevant to the goal
- What remains unknown (if anything) and why
- A clear recommendation that helps the collector decide ADVANCE_PHASE vs ROUTE_BACK
