Merge and consolidate the following planning results from multiple agents:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Planning Results: {{ planningResults }}

Create structured tickets with:
- Ticket ID and title
- Clear implementation tasks
- Dependencies between tickets
- Acceptance criteria
- Estimated effort

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Conflicting tickets or dependencies need resolution
- Unsure how to merge overlapping ticket scopes
- Unsure whether to split or combine tickets further
- Unsure about advancing to execution vs. requesting more planning

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

Return a routing object with exactly one of:
- interruptRequest: { type, reason, contextForDecision, choices, confirmationItems, ticketConsolidation, dependencyResolution, consolidatedTickets, dependencyConflicts }
- collectorResult: { schemaVersion, resultId, inputs, mergeStrategy, conflictResolutions, aggregatedMetrics, consolidatedOutput, collectorDecision { decisionType, rationale, requestedPhase }, upstreamContextChain, metadata, finalizedTickets, dependencyGraph, discoveryResultId, planningCuration }
- orchestratorCollectorRequest: { goal, phase }
- discoveryOrchestratorRequest: { goal }
- planningRequest: { goal }
- ticketOrchestratorRequest: { goal, discoveryCuration, planningCuration }
- ticketState: { request: { goal, discoveryCuration, planningCuration } }
- reviewRequest: { content, criteria, returnToOrchestratorCollector?, returnToDiscoveryCollector?, returnToPlanningCollector?, returnToTicketCollector?, returnToContextCollector? }
- mergerRequest: { mergeContext, mergeSummary, conflictFiles, returnToOrchestratorCollector?, returnToDiscoveryCollector?, returnToPlanningCollector?, returnToTicketCollector?, returnToContextCollector? }

Happy path guidance:
- Normally return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "TICKETS".
- Do NOT jump directly to ticketOrchestratorRequest unless explicitly looping/branching; use collectorResult so the branch handler advances the workflow.
