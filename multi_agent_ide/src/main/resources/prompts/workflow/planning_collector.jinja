Merge and consolidate the following planning results from multiple agents:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Planning Results: {{ planningResults }}

Create structured tickets with:
- Ticket ID and title
- Clear implementation tasks
- Dependencies between tickets
- Acceptance criteria
- Estimated effort

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

{% include "workflow/_collector_base.jinja" %}

Happy path: return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "TICKETS".
If you need review/validation, set reviewRequest. If you need merge/conflict handling, set mergerRequest.
If you believe ROUTE_BACK is required, first emit interruptRequest explaining why; only ROUTE_BACK after clarification confirms it.
Only set contextManagerRequest when you need specific missing context from another agent chat/history.
