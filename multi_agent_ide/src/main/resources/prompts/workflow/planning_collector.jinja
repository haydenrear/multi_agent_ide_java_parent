Merge and consolidate the following planning results from multiple agents:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Planning Results: {{ planningResults }}

Create structured tickets with:
- Ticket ID and title
- Clear implementation tasks
- Dependencies between tickets
- Acceptance criteria
- Estimated effort

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

{% include "workflow/_collector_base.jinja" %}

Happy path: return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "TICKETS".
If you need review/validation, set reviewRequest. If you need merge/conflict handling, set mergerRequest or handle the conflicts yourself and commit them.
If you believe planning is insufficient, follow the Route-Back Review Protocol:
in your structured JSON response, return a result with only `interruptRequest` populated, explaining the planning gaps.
After review, if approved: set collectorResult with ROUTE_BACK so planning runs again.
After review, if rejected: set collectorResult with ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "TICKETS",
filling in finalizedTickets and dependencyGraph with the best available plan.
Only set contextManagerRequest when you need specific missing context from another agent chat/history.
