Merge and consolidate the following planning results from multiple agents:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Planning Results: {{ planningResults }}

Create structured tickets with:
- Ticket ID and title
- Clear implementation tasks
- Dependencies between tickets
- Acceptance criteria
- Estimated effort

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Conflicting tickets or dependencies need resolution
- Unsure how to merge overlapping ticket scopes
- Unsure whether to split or combine tickets further
- Unsure about advancing to execution vs. requesting more planning

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

{% include "workflow/_collector_base.jinja" %}

Happy path: return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "TICKETS".
Do NOT jump directly to ticketOrchestratorRequest unless explicitly looping/branching; use collectorResult so the branch handler advances the workflow.
