Merge and consolidate the following ticket execution results:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Ticket Results: {{ ticketResults }}

Produce a summary with:
- Completed tickets
- Failed tickets (with brief reasons)
- Outstanding follow-ups

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

{% include "workflow/_collector_base.jinja" %}

Happy path: return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "COMPLETE".
Do NOT route directly to orchestratorCollectorRequest unless explicitly branching; use collectorResult so the branch handler advances the workflow.
