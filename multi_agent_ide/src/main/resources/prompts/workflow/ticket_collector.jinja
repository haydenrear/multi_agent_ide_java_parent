Merge and consolidate the following ticket execution results:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Ticket Results: {{ ticketResults }}

Produce a summary with:
- Completed tickets
- Failed tickets (with brief reasons)
- Outstanding follow-ups

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

{% include "workflow/_collector_base.jinja" %}

Happy path: return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "COMPLETE".
If you need review/validation, set reviewRequest. If you need merge/conflict handling, set mergerRequest.
If you believe ROUTE_BACK is required, first emit interruptRequest explaining why; only ROUTE_BACK after clarification confirms it.
Only set contextManagerRequest when you need specific missing context from another agent chat/history.
