Merge and consolidate the following ticket execution results:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Ticket Results: {{ ticketResults }}

Produce a summary with:
- Completed tickets
- Failed tickets (with brief reasons)
- Outstanding follow-ups

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure whether work is complete or requires follow-up tickets
- Unsure about interpretation of test/verification results
- Unsure about routing back to execution vs. finalize
- Conflicting completion signals across tickets

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

Return a routing object with exactly one of:
- interruptRequest: { type, reason, contextForDecision, choices, confirmationItems, completionStatus, followUps, verificationResults }
- collectorResult: { schemaVersion, resultId, inputs, mergeStrategy, conflictResolutions, aggregatedMetrics, consolidatedOutput, collectorDecision { decisionType, rationale, requestedPhase }, upstreamContextChain, metadata, completionStatus, followUps, ticketCuration }
- ticketRequest: { goal, discoveryCuration, planningCuration }
- orchestratorCollectorRequest: { goal, phase }
- reviewRequest: { content, criteria, returnToOrchestratorCollector?, returnToDiscoveryCollector?, returnToPlanningCollector?, returnToTicketCollector?, returnToContextCollector? }
- mergerRequest: { mergeContext, mergeSummary, conflictFiles, returnToOrchestratorCollector?, returnToDiscoveryCollector?, returnToPlanningCollector?, returnToTicketCollector?, returnToContextCollector? }

Happy path guidance:
- Normally return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "COMPLETE".
- Do NOT route directly to orchestratorCollectorRequest unless explicitly branching; use collectorResult so the branch handler advances the workflow.
