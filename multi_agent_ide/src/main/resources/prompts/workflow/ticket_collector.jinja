Merge and consolidate the following ticket execution results:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Ticket Results: {{ ticketResults }}

Produce a summary with:
- Completed tickets
- Failed tickets (with brief reasons)
- Outstanding follow-ups

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

{% include "workflow/_collector_base.jinja" %}

Happy path: return collectorResult with collectorDecision.decisionType = ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "COMPLETE".
If you need review/validation, set reviewRequest. If you need merge/conflict handling, set mergerRequest or handle the conflicts yourself and commit them.
If you believe ticket execution is insufficient, follow the Route-Back Review Protocol:
in your structured JSON response, return a result with only `interruptRequest` populated, explaining what tickets failed or are incomplete.
After review, if approved: set collectorResult with ROUTE_BACK so ticket execution runs again.
After review, if rejected: set collectorResult with ADVANCE_PHASE and requestedPhase = "COMPLETE",
filling in completionStatus and followUps with what was accomplished and what remains.
Only set contextManagerRequest when you need specific missing context from another agent chat/history.
