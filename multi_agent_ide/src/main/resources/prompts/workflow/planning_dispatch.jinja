Dispatch the planning workflow results to the next step.

Goal: {{ goal }}
Planning Results: {{ planningResults }}

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure how to distribute tickets among agents
- Unsure which tickets require additional discovery context
- Unsure whether to wait for missing planning results before consolidating

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

Return a routing object with exactly one of:
- interruptRequest: { type, reason, contextForDecision, choices, confirmationItems, agentAssignments, ticketDistribution, discoveryContextRouting, routingRationale }
- planningCollectorRequest: { goal, planningResults }
