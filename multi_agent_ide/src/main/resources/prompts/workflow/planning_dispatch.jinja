Dispatch the planning workflow results to the next step.

Goal: {{ goal }}
Planning Results: {{ planningResults }}

Primary routing behavior:
- Default to `planningCollectorRequest` to move workflow forward.
- Use that request to consolidate all planning agent outputs into a single planning collector input.
- Include enough synthesis/context so the collector can choose ADVANCE_PHASE vs ROUTE_BACK confidently.
