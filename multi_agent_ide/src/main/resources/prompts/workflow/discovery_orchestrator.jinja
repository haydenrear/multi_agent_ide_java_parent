Coordinate the following multi-agent workflow:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Phase: {{ phase }}

Based on this information and files you find on the repository, or information about the ticket,
decide how to divide up the discovery phase of the workflow.

Fan-out policy:
- Default to exactly 1 discovery agent request.
- Only use more than 1 discovery agent request when the goal is truly complex and can be split into independent, non-overlapping discovery tracks.
- Prefer a single broad request over multiple narrow requests unless parallelism is clearly necessary.
- If you fan out (>1), include clear delegation rationale explaining why 1 agent is insufficient and why each request can run independently.
- Keep request count minimal even when fanning out.
