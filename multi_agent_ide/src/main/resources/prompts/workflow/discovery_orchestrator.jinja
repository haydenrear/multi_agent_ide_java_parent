Coordinate the following multi-agent workflow:

Goal: {{ goal }}
Phase: {{ phase }}

Based on this information and files you find on the repository, or information about the ticket,
decide how to divide up the discovery phase of the workflow.

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure how to partition subdomains or allocate discovery focus areas
- Unsure which scope boundaries are in or out of goal
- Unsure about prioritizing coverage goals or depth vs breadth
- Unsure which discovery strategy best fits the goal constraints
