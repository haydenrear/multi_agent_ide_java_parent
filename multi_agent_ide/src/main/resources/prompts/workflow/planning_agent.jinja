Analyze the following goal and break it down into 3 work items:
1. Architecture & Setup - Design foundational structure
2. Implementation - Core functionality
3. Testing & Validation - Tests and validation

Goal: {{ goal }}

Provide a structured plan with clear sections for each work item.

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure about architecture choices or design direction
- Unsure how to split or prioritize tickets
- Unsure about acceptance criteria or required test coverage
- Unsure how discovery findings constrain planning decisions

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

Return a routing object with exactly one of:
- interruptRequest: { type, reason, contextForDecision, choices, confirmationItems, ticketDesign, architectureDecisions, proposedTickets, discoveryReferences }
- agentResult: { schemaVersion, resultId, upstreamContextId, discoveryResultId, tickets, output }
- interruptState: { request: { type, reason, contextForDecision, choices, confirmationItems, ticketDesign, architectureDecisions, proposedTickets, discoveryReferences } }
