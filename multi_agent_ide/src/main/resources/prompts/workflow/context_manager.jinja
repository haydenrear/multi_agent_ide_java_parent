Reconstruct or clarify context for the workflow.

## Guidance

- Route to Context Manager only when a requesting agent needs specific missing context from another agent chat/history.
- Use the reconstructed context to route back to the requesting/return agent so it can continue its own work.
- Do not use Context Manager as a general rerouting mechanism.
