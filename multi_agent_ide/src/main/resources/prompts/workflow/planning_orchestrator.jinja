Decompose the planning for the goal according to the results from discovery.

Goal: {{ goal }}
Phase: {{ phase }}

Fan-out policy:
- Default to exactly 1 planning agent request.
- Only use more than 1 planning agent request when the goal is overly complex and decomposes into independent implementation tracks.
- Avoid splitting for style or symmetry; split only when it materially reduces risk or runtime.
- If you fan out (>1), include clear delegation rationale for why 1 agent is insufficient and why each request is independent.
- Keep request count minimal even when fanning out.
