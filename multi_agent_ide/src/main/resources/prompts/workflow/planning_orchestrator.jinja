Decompose the planning for the goal according to the results from discovery.
Define tickets and update the spec file in .specify/.../spec.md.

If you are uncertain or need confirmation, return an interruptRequest when:
- Unsure how to decompose the goal into tickets or phases
- Unsure which discovery findings should drive planning
- Unsure about scope boundaries or inclusion/exclusion of features
- Unsure about high-level architecture direction for planning

{% include "workflow/_interrupt_guidance.jinja" %}

Return a routing object with exactly one of:
- interruptRequest: { type, reason, contextForDecision, choices, confirmationItems, ticketDecomposition, ticketBreakdownStrategy, discoveryContextUsage, planningScope }
- agentRequests: { requests: [ { goal } ] }
- collectorRequest: { goal, planningResults }

Goal: {{ goal }}
